## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit `styles.css` at the top where CSS variables are defined:
```css
:root {
    --accent-primary: #3b82f6;  /* Change this for primary color */
    --accent-secondary: #8b5cf6; /* Change this for secondary color */
}
```

### Changing Content
All content is in `index.html`. The structure is clearly commented:
- Sections are marked with `<!-- Section Name -->`
- Update text directly in the HTML
- Add/remove projects in the projects section

### Changing Typing Animation Phrases
Edit `script.js` around line 75:
```javascript
const phrases = [
    'Machine Learning Engineer',
    'AI Enthusiast',
    // Add your phrases here
];
```
